## Locational data

* Geographic information: __locational information__ and attribute information

* Central question: how do we locate features on the Earth's surface?  

---

## Digitizing 

* __Digitizing__ (from your textbook): "the process by which coordinates from a map, image, or other sources are converted into a digital format in a GIS."

* Types of digitizing: 
 + Manual: "heads-up" and "heads-down" digitizing
 + Automated: scanning, vectorization



---

## "Heads-up" digitizing

* Your textbook calls it _on-screen digitizing_

---

## "Heads-down" digitizing

* Use of a tablet, or "puck," to trace features on a paper map

## Snapping and tolerance

---

## Georeferencing

* In order to work properly with newly-digitized data, the data must be aligned to a __coordinate system__

* This requires coordinate transformation through ___georeferencing___

---

## Coordinate transformation

---

## Control points and RMSE

* __Affine transformation__: linear equation used for coordinate transformation

* __Root mean square error (RMSE)__: measurement of error in georeferencing

---

## Surveying

* __Surveying__: field collection of locational information using both direct and indirect measurements

* Basic techniques: location determined based on __distance__ and __angles__

---

## Control points (datum)

* Datum locations based on previously-surveyed __control points__

---

## Trilateration

* Determination of point location based on __distance only__

* Interactive example: Locating unknown point C, which is 9400m from measured point A and 7000m from measured point B

* Next: locate unknown point D, which is 9600m from point A and 8000m from point C

* Exercise source: DiBiase, D., _The Nature of Geographic Information_

## Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)

* NAVSTAR: United States system
 + Commonly referred to as the Global Positioning System (GPS)
 
* GLONASS: Russian system

* Other systems: 
 + Galileo: EU system
 + Beidou: Chinese system
 


---

## NAVSTAR GPS

* Satellite system launched by the US Department of Defense

* 31 satellites currently in orbit

* At least four satellites should be in view of every point on the Earth's surface at all times; often, 8-12 are in view

* Controlled by set of control stations (master station in Colorado)

---

## GNSS positioning: range distances

* __Range distance__: distance between satellite in space and GPS receiver

* Range is equal to __the speed of light * the time of signal transmission__

## Precision and accuracy

<img src=assets/img/precision.gif style="width: 500px">

---

## GPS: other issues

* GPS satellites use the __WGS 1984__ datum

* Sources of error: 
 + Atmospheric interference
 + Imprecise receiver clocks
 + Satellite position (e.g. satellites clustered together)

## Differential correction

* Error measured at a nearby __base station__; correction applied to GPS receiver
