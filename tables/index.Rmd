## Attribute data

* Attribute information in a GIS: what are we mapping?

* Types of attributes:
  + Nominal
  + Ordinal
  + Interval
  + Ratio
  

---

## Nominal

* Nominal attributes are __descriptive__
* As nominal data are __qualitative__, there is no inherent ranking or order to their values
* Example: electoral map

<span class="footnote">Source: http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2008/</span>

---

## Ordinal

* Ordinal attributes convey __ranking__
* Ordinal data do not say anything about relationships between ranks -- just their order
* Example: ranked clergy compensation

<span class="footnote">Source: http://www.cpg.org/research</span>

---

## Interval

* Interval data: quantitative, but __no natural zero__
* Scale might be __additive__, but not __multiplicative__
* Example: temperature (from Natural Weather Service)

<img src=assets/img/temp.png style="width: 450px">

---

## Ratio

* Ratio data: __quantitative__ with a __true zero__
* As such, multiplication makes sense ($12 is three times more than $4)
* Example: Income in Dallas/Fort Worth (source: [radicalcartography.net](http://www.radicalcartography.net/index.html?cityincome))

<img src=assets/img/income.png style="width: 800px">

---

## Databases

* __Database__: organized collection of data (e.g., your table)
* __Database management system (DBMS)__: program that facilitates database storage, access, analysis, and manipulation

* GIS data storage based on DBMS principles

---

## Flat files

* Rows of information stored as text or binary files
* Examples: comma-delimited (.csv) files, spreadsheets

<img src=assets/img/flat.png style="width: 800px">

---

## Relational databases

* Multiple tables that can be associated with one another based on common fields
* Relations determined by user; not set beforehand
* Relationships defined based on __relational algebra__

---

## Attribute data in a GIS: the __table__

<img src=assets/img/table.png style="width: 800px">

---

## Rows and columns

<img src=assets/img/rowcol.png style="width: 750px">

---

## Field types

* Numeric
  + Integers (short or long)
  + Floating-point numbers (float or double)
  + __Precision__: length of numeric field
  + __Scale__: number of decimal places in numeric field
* Text (string)
* Dates
* Binary Large Objects (BLOBs)

Field values restricted based on their __domain__

## Joining and relating tables in a GIS

* In a GIS, tables can be associated with each other through __joins__ or __relates__

* __Join__: attributes from __target table__ merged to a __source table__

* __Relate__: attributes from target table associated with source table; not merged in

* Joins and relates based upon a __key field__

---

## Understanding "key fields"

---

## Joins

<img src=assets/img/joins.png style="width: 650px">

---

## Types of joins

* Inner join: __only the matching rows__ are retained

* Outer join: __all rows are retained__, regardless of the presence or absence of a match between source and target tables 

* Left (outer) join: __all rows in the source table__ are retained

---

## Inner vs. outer joins

<img src=assets/img/innerouter.png style="width: 800px">

---

## Cardinality

The directionality of the join or relate is important!

* __One-to-one (1:1)__: one record in source table for each record in target table

* __Many-to-one (m:1)__: multiple records in source table for each record in target table

* __One-to-many (1:m)__: one record in source table corresponds to multiple records in target table

* __Many-to-many (m:m)__: multiple corresponding records in both source and target tables

---

## Joins and relates in ArcGIS

* 1:1 and m:1 relationships handled through __joins__

* 1:m and m:m relationships handled through __relates__

* Key fields need not have the same name; however, __they must be the same field type__

---

## Example: inner join

<img src=assets/img/inner.png style="width: 850px">

---

## Example: inner join

<img src=assets/img/inner2.png style="width: 850px">

---

## Example: Left (outer) join

<img src=assets/img/left.png style="width: 800px">

---

## Queries

* Records can be accessed within databases through the use of __queries__

* Queries commonly used to subset data based on a given set of desired attribute values

---

## Select by Attributes

* Tool in ArcGIS Pro for subsetting data based on query expression

* Options: __Clause mode__ and __SQL mode__

---

## Clause mode

<img src=assets/img/clause.PNG style="width: 800px">

---

## __S__tructured __Q__uery __L__anguage (SQL)

* Common language for querying databases

Example SQL statement: 
```sql
SELECT * FROM Texas_counties WHERE "Total" > 500000
```
* Partial version can be used in ArcGIS to select and subset data

---

## SQL mode
