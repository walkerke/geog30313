## Spatial data analysis

* The study of data using their __spatial__ or __geographic__ properties

* What might be some examples of spatial data analysis?

## Spatial analysis

---

## Spatial operations

## Adjacency

---

## Proximity

---

## Spatial queries: adjacency

---

## Spatial queries: containment

---

## Map overlay

---

## The "point-in-polygon" problem

---

## Map overlay and spatial queries

* Example: Which elementary schools in Fort Worth are in the most impoverished neighborhoods?

---

## Spatial joins

* Attributes joined from one layer to another based on _location_

---

## Geoprocessing

* Definition (adapted from ESRI): the execution of operations on spatial data __to create new information__; __to enhance its spatial structure__; or __to analyze interrelationships between existing information__.  

* In short: involves the manipulation of geographic data for the purposes of data management and data analysis

---

## Clip

* Creates a new layer from an input layer using a second layer as a "cookie cutter."  

<img src=assets/img/clip.png style="width: 800px">

---

## Intersect

* Creates a new layer that is a geometric intersection of the input layers

<img src=assets/img/intersect.png style="width: 800px">

---

## Union

* Data from input layers combined to create output layers

<img src=assets/img/union.png style="width: 800px">

---

## Merge

* Combines two datasets into a single output dataset

<img src=assets/img/merge.png style="width: 800px">

---

## Other examples

* Erase
* Identity
* Symmetrical difference
* Update

Not all geoprocessing tasks available at all license levels of ArcGIS

## Sliver polygons

---

## Dissolve

* Used to combine features with shared attribute(s)

<img src=assets/img/dissolve.gif style="width: 500px">

---

## Buffering

* A __buffer__ is a feature that delineates the area within a given distance of an input feature 

<img src=assets/img/buffer.gif style="width: 700px">

---

## Buffering, continued

<img src=assets/img/buffer2.png style="width: 800px">

## Applications of spatial analysis

<img src=assets/img/chisholm.png style="width: 700px">

---

## Applications of spatial analysis

* How would you use spatial analysis to solve the following problem? 

* Think of the different operations and tool(s) that would be a part of your solution
