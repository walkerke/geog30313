## Interactive mapping

* [NYT college football fan map](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/03/upshot/ncaa-football-map.html)

* For discussion: 
 + What is 'interactive' about this map?  
 + How does this map differ from a static map?  Is it better?  
 


---

## Web 2.0 and geographic information

* __Web 2.0__: emphasis on user-generated content and the web as a platform

* Internet content not simply top-down, but highly interactive

* Demand for applications that allow users to interact with (and create their own!) geographic data

---

## Examples of Web 2.0

* [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com)

* [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/51.500/-0.100)

* [Mapping Twitter data](http://srogers.cartodb.com/viz/98cb3c42-4d7b-11e4-b811-0e4fddd5de28/embed_map)

## Web maps vs. GIS

* For discussion: can an internet mapping application be considered a GIS?  

---

## Web GIS

* Designed to simulate desktop GIS experience in a browser or on a mobile device

* However, whereas a desktop GIS is geared toward a trained user (you all!), internet GIS applications should be designed for the average Internet user

## Client/server architecture

* **Web server** hosts and serves sites and data to be consumed by **web clients** (e.g. your browser)

## The distributed GIS process

## GIS servers

* Server: machine that hosts and "serves" GIS services to clients

* GIS server software: ArcGIS for Server, GeoServer, MapServer (open source)

## Geospatial web services

* **Map services**: geospatial data (maps) serves as images (e.g. JPEG, PNG)

 * **Tiled map service**: maps generated from pre-made "tiles" stored in server's cache
 
* **Feature services**: geospatial data served as vectors
 * Allow users to create, edit, delete, and query data


---

## Tiled mapping

* To speed browsing, web maps often display map services as "tiles"

* Tiles are defined by their **zoom level** and **coordinates**

## The Web Mercator coordinate system

* Web mapping systems commonly use a variant of the Mercator projection

* Mercator used because of its **conformal** and **cylindrical** properties

---

## Web map design

* Principles of web map design: 
 * Generalization
 * Scalability
 * Minimalism

---

## Generalization

* Important to consider purpose of your map when selecting resolution of your data

<img src=assets/img/general.png style="width: 800px">


---

## Generalization

* At small scales, lots of detail can be unnecessary and computationally burdensome 

* Large feature services can be very slow in web maps

* When building applications, ask yourself: how much detail do I need?

* In ArcGIS: look for the "Generalization" toolset in the "Cartography" toolbox

---

## Scalability

Example: [Educational Attainment in America](http://personal.tcu.edu/kylewalker/maps/education)

---

## Minimalism (when appropriate)

## Minimalist solution

## Principles of public-facing interfaces

From Brian Timoney - web maps should be:

* Fast
* Intuitive
* Informative
* Fast

## Cloud computing

* Computing services that are served remotely over a network; not on an in-house physical server

* Types: 
 * Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
 * Platform as a Service (PaaS)
 * Software as a Service (Saas)


---

## Cloud computing

* Benefits: 
 * Pay-as-you-go model
 * Less need to maintain/replace server hardware
 * Efficiency (less power, air conditioning, space, etc.)
 
* Drawbacks: 
 * Privacy concerns
 * Vendor constraints

---

## ArcGIS Online

* Subscription-based service; links with ArcGIS suite of products

* Hosts data as tiled or feature services

* Limitations: 
 * Can only display a maximum of 1000 features
 * Confusing pricing structure
 
* Link: http://www.arcgis.com

## Tutorial: ArcGIS Online

* Hundreds of World Regional Geography students at TCU have learned to make web maps with ArcGIS Online

* Let's check it out!

---

## CARTO

* Spatial database in the cloud

* Free accounts for students; enterprise plans tailored toward businesses

* Powerful interface for running queries, visualizing your data; dashboard capabilities

* Link: http://www.carto.com

## Mapbox/Mapbox Studio

* Mapbox Studio: Interactive design tool for web cartography; generates _vector tiles_

* 'Freemium' service; will store certain amount of data for free, costs money for more storage
